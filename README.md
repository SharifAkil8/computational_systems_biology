# Computational and Systems Biology Homework
This repository contains a set of code-based solutions developed for the homework assignments in ECEN453: Computational and Systems Biology.
This course provides the required biology primer and covers functional genomics, transcriptomics, differential expression, clustering, classification, 
prediction, biomarker discovery, pathway analysis and network based approaches to high throughput biological data analysis. Includes the development 
of databases, algorithms, web-based and other tools regarding management and analysis of life science data. Areas of study include DNA, RNA, and protein 
sequence analysis, functional genomics and proteomics, 3D macromolecule structure prediction, and systems/network approach.
